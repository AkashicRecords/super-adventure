# Collaborative AI Development Environment README

Welcome to our collaborative AI development, testing, and experimentation environment repository! This repository is designed to be a versatile space for Python 3-based projects, including code, media files, and documents. It serves as a catch-all for various resources that need to be shared and accessed by team members.

## Repository Structure
- `/code`: This directory contains Python 3 scripts and modules for AI development and experimentation.
- `/media`: Here you can find media files such as images, videos, and audio relevant to our projects.
- `/documents`: Store documentation, reports, and other written materials in this directory.
- `/misc`: For any other miscellaneous files that do not fit into the above categories.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up Python 3


#### For Mac
1. **Install Homebrew**: If you haven't already, install Homebrew by following the instructions on the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh).
2. **Install Python 3**: Run the following command in your terminal:
brew install python

3. **Verify Python 3 installation**: Run the following command to verify that Python 3 has been installed successfully:
python3 --version

#### For Windows
1. **Download Python 3 installer**: Download the Python 3 installer from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Run the installer**: Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Python 3.
3. **Verify Python 3 installation**: Open a new command prompt or PowerShell and run the following command to verify that Python 3 has been installed successfully:
python --version


### Accessing OpenAI API

To access the OpenAI API, sign up for an API key on the [OpenAI website](https://www.openai.com). Follow the instructions provided to get your API key and use it in your Python scripts to interact with the OpenAI API.

### Using CrewAI and LLaMA-3 

To use CrewAI and LLaMA-3 or AI development, visit their respective websites to download and install the applications:
- **CrewAI**: Visit the [CrewAI website](https://www.crewai.com) to download the application for collaborative AI development.
- **LLaMA-3**: Visit the [LLaMA-3 website](https://www.llama3.com) to download the application for AI experimentation.

# Installing CrewAI with pip3 on Mac and Windows

## General Instructions

These instructions assume that you have Python 3 and `pip3` already installed on your system. If you haven't installed Python 3, please refer to the official Python [installation guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

1. **Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)**: You'll need to use the command line interface on your computer.
2. **Install CrewAI**: Run the following command to install CrewAI using `pip3`:

# Setting Up and Fine-Tuning LLaMA 3 with Python

## Setting Up Python Environment Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later.
- CUDA-compatible GPU for fine-tuning (recommended for performance).

### Install PyTorch
Ensure that PyTorch is installed with GPU support if you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU. Install PyTorch by following the instructions on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/).

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

# Running LLaMA 3 Locally with Python (Not Finished)

## Prerequisites

Before running LLaMA 3 locally, you need to ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. **Python 3.8 or later**: Install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you haven't already.

2. **PyTorch**: Install PyTorch following the instructions on the official website (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

3. **Git**: Install Git from the official website (https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you haven't already.

4. **LLaMA 3 Model**: You need to obtain the LLaMA 3 model files. Since the model is large, it is not included in the repository. You can download the model files from the official repository or other trusted sources.

## Step 1: Clone the LLaMA 3 Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the LLaMA 3 repository. Then, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama.git

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

3. Make your changes and commit them:
git commit -m "Description of your changes"

4. Push your branch to GitHub and open a pull request.
